## Known sponsored internships
These companies have been **known to sponsor international visas for internships** in the past. This does not necessarily mean they will for you, just that it *has* happened in the past more than once, so it should hopefully be negotiable. Any restrictions on who can receive these internships or in what contexts is given in the Countries Available and Extra Conditions columns.
